# DB-Challenge-2024 Part 1

This project uses `yarn`` as package manager.

I ran out of time, which means that the data modelling is not finished.

There are examples of Utility types and parts of the modelling types.


I have implemented type testing using `vitest --typecheck`

Not all utility types and modelling types have tests.

The implemented Type tests can be run by executing
```bash
yarn test
```
