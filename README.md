# DB-Challenge-2024 Part 1

This project uses yarn as package manager.

There are Utility types and parts of the modelling types.

I have implemente type testing using vitest

Not all utility types and modelling types have tests.

The implemented Type tests can be run by executing
```bash
yarn test
```


I ran out of time, which means that the data modelling is not finish.
